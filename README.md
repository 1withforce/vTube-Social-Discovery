An extremely simple page that is a hacked down bootstrap template with a few lit elements that do all the work.

No serverside communication required.

Edit `data/domains.js` to add/remove the sites shown.

## TODO

- Remove remnants of bootstrap, make pure html5

- Allow a URI to be specified as a parameter in `m-instance-list` to optionally be used instead of the static `domains.js` file.

- Fix styling/colors to be not terrible

- Sleep
